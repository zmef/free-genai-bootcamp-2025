Instructor Response:

Let's begin by exploring some relevant vocabulary:

Toki Pona	English
mi	I/me
sona	know/learn
kama	come/become
toki	language
pona	good/simple
In Toki Pona, a basic sentence structure follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.

Consider the following:

Subject: Which word represents "I/me"?
Verb: Which word conveys the action of learning?
Object: Which word stands for "Toki Pona"?
Hint: Think about how "kama" (to come/become) and "sona" (to know/learn) can be combined to express the concept of learning.

Can you construct the sentence "I am learning Toki Pona" using this structure and vocabulary?
