## Risks:
Limited User Engagement:
Solution: Start by targeting communities that already have an interest in Toki Pona, such as online forums, social media groups, and educational platforms. Offer free trials or a freemium model to attract initial users, gather feedback, and build word-of-mouth marketing. Additionally, adding gamification or community-driven features (like leaderboards or user-generated content) could help maintain long-term engagement.
Financial Sustainability:
Solution: Initially, focus on low-cost marketing channels like social media, word of mouth, and partnerships with language enthusiasts or influencers. Consider a crowdfunding campaign to raise initial funds, or apply for small grants aimed at supporting educational projects. Also, ensure the app has a monetization strategy from the start (such as premium features or in-app purchases) to create a sustainable revenue stream.
Technical Debt:
Solution: Adopt a modular development approach to keep the codebase manageable. Prioritize a minimal viable product (MVP) approach to avoid overengineering. Use open-source tools and libraries where possible to reduce development time. Regularly review and refactor the codebase, even if it means postponing new features in favor of maintaining stability.
## Assumptions:
Adequate Interest in Toki Pona:
Solution: Validate the assumption early by conducting surveys or beta testing with the target audience. Engage with Toki Pona communities to gauge interest and refine the app’s features based on direct feedback. If demand is lower than expected, consider expanding the app to teach multiple niche languages or incorporate language-related content that appeals to a broader audience.
Simple App Design:
Solution: Focus on user-centric design with a focus on core functionality rather than complexity. Conduct user testing frequently, especially with Toki Pona learners, to refine the app’s simplicity and usability. Gradually introduce features as user demand increases, ensuring the core design remains streamlined.
Access to Open-Source Resources:
Solution: Make use of open-source tools and libraries for language learning, such as spaced repetition systems (SRS), and look for Toki Pona-specific resources online. If necessary, partner with the community to share resources, or collaborate with language experts to create supplemental materials. Alternatively, leverage existing free educational content while keeping the app’s features focused on user experience rather than content creation.
## Constraints:
Budget Constraints:
Solution: Keep development costs low by using free tools, frameworks, and hosting services. Outsource only critical tasks (like design or marketing) to freelancers when possible, ensuring that the majority of work is handled in-house. Begin with a small-scale project and scale over time as funds allow.
Solo Developer:
Solution: Consider using no-code or low-code development tools for certain aspects of the app (like prototyping or UI design) to reduce the development load. Break down the project into small, manageable chunks and focus on delivering the most critical features first. Utilize online communities for feedback and support to minimize the burden of solo development.
Platform Limitations:
Solution: Start by focusing on a single platform (such as Android or web) to simplify development. Use cross-platform frameworks (like Flutter or React Native) once the basic features are in place, or build a progressive web app (PWA) for a more flexible solution. This allows you to reach a broader audience over time without overextending resources in the beginning.
