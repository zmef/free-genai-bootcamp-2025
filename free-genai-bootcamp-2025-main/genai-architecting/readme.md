# Toki Pona Language Learning App

## Overview
This project aims to create a language-learning app for Toki Pona, focusing on simplicity, engagement, and accessibility for learners. The app will be designed with a minimal viable product (MVP) approach to reduce costs and scale gradually.

## Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### Risks

1. **Limited User Engagement**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Target communities already interested in Toki Pona (e.g., online forums, social media groups).
     - Offer free trials or a freemium model to attract initial users and gather feedback.
     - Add gamification or community-driven features (e.g., leaderboards, user-generated content) to increase engagement and retention.

2. **Financial Sustainability**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use low-cost marketing channels (social media, word of mouth, partnerships with influencers).
     - Consider crowdfunding campaigns or small educational grants to raise funds.
     - Implement a monetization strategy early (e.g., premium features, in-app purchases) to ensure revenue generation.

3. **Technical Debt**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use a modular development approach to keep the codebase manageable.
     - Focus on an MVP to avoid unnecessary complexity.
     - Use open-source tools and libraries to speed up development.
     - Regularly review and refactor code to maintain stability, even if it means delaying new features.

### Assumptions

1. **Adequate Interest in Toki Pona**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Validate interest early through surveys or beta testing with target users.
     - Engage with the Toki Pona community to refine app features based on feedback.
     - If demand is low, consider expanding the app to teach multiple niche languages or add broader language-related content.

2. **Simple App Design**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Prioritize user-centric design, focusing on core functionality.
     - Conduct regular user testing to refine simplicity and usability.
     - Gradually introduce new features as user demand grows, ensuring the core design remains streamlined.

3. **Access to Open-Source Resources**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Leverage open-source tools and libraries (e.g., spaced repetition systems) for language learning.
     - Collaborate with the Toki Pona community or language experts to create supplementary materials.
     - Use existing free educational content while focusing on improving the user experience.

### Constraints

1. **Budget Constraints**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use free tools, frameworks, and hosting services to minimize development costs.
     - Outsource critical tasks (e.g., design, marketing) to freelancers as needed, ensuring most work is handled in-house.
     - Start with a small-scale app and scale up as resources allow.

2. **Solo Developer**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use no-code or low-code tools for parts of the app (e.g., UI/UX design or prototyping) to lighten the development load.
     - Break the project into small, manageable tasks and focus on critical features first.
     - Engage with online communities for feedback and support to reduce the solo workload.

3. **Platform Limitations**
   - **Solution**: 
     - Start with a single platform (e.g., Android or web) to keep development focused.
     - Use cross-platform frameworks (e.g., Flutter, React Native) for scalability once the core features are stable.
     - Consider a progressive web app (PWA) for flexible cross-platform support with minimal extra cost.
